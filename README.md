# cot-4500-Pro1

To run this program:
1. Navigate to the `src` directory
2. Then, navigate to the `test` directory
3. Run the command `python test_assignment_1.py` to print results to console.


There are 4 functions in this assignment:
1. root_two(x0, tolerance): Takes an initial guess and a tolerance to solve for root(2) through approximation. 
2. bisection_method(a, b, tolerance, f): Takes an interval [a,b], tolerance and a function to solve with the bisection method.
3. fixed_point_iteration(x0, tolerance, max_iterations): Takes an initial value, tolerance and a max iteration count to solve through fixed point iteration.
4. newton_method(f, df, x0, tolerance, max_iterations): Takes a function defined as f, it's derivative df, tolerance and max iteration count to solve through Newton-Raphson method.
